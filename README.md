## Aliases for Mac terminal

To get the bash aliases to work, you need to copy both the .bash_profile and .bashrc to the home directory `cd ~` and restart your terminal. You can refresh .bashrc in session by calling `. ~/.bashrc`. If you already have these files, you can just copy and paste the pieces you want into the existing files.

* `bash/.bash_profile`
  * Includes colors for ls command and autoload of ~/.bashrc
* `bash/.bashrc`
  * Includes useful aliases for development on mac
